Consider a schema representing projects within a company, containing the following information:

- pNum - project's unique identifying number
- pName - name of project
- eNum - employee's unique identifying number
- eName - name of employee
- jobClass - type of job that employee has on this project
- payRate - hourly rate, dependent on the kind of job being done
- hours - total hours worked in this job by this employee

This schema started out life as a large spreadsheet and now the company wants to put it into a database system.
As a spreadsheet, its schema is: R(pNum, pName, eNum, eName, jobClass, payRate, hours)

Based on the above description:
a. Devise a suitable set of functional dependencies among these attributes.
b. Using these functional dependencies, decompose R into a set of BCNF relations.
c. State whether the new relations are also in 3NF.
