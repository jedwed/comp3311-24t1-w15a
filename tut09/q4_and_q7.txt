## Question 4

Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D).
For each of the following sets of functional dependencies,
assuming that those are the only dependencies that hold for R, do the following:

a. List all of the candidate keys for R.
b. Show whether R is in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)?
c. Show whether R is in third normal form (3NF)?

i. C → D, C → A, B → C
ii. B → C, D → A
iii. ABC → D, D → A
iv. A → B, BC → D, A → C
v. AB → C, AB → D, C → A, D → B
vi. A → BCD

## Question 7

For each of the sets of dependencies in question 4:
if R is not already in 3NF, decompose it into a set of 3NF relations
if R is not already in BCNF, decompose it into a set of BCNF relations
