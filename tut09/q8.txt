Consider (yet another) banking application that contains information about accounts, branches and customers.
Each account is held at a specific branch,
but a customer may hold more than one account and an account may have more than one associated customer.

Consider an unnormalised relation containing all of the attributes that are relevant to this application:

- acct# - unique account indentifier
- branch# - unique branch identifier
- tfn - unique customer identifier (tax file number)
- kind - type of account (savings, cheque, ...)
- balance - amount of money in account
- city - city where branch is located
- name - customer's name

i.e. consider the relation R(acct#, branch#, tfn, kind, balance, city, name)

Based on the above description:
a. Devise a suitable set of functional dependencies among these attributes.
b. Using these functional dependencies, decompose R into a set of 3NF relations.
c. State whether the new relations are also in BCNF.
