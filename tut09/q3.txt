Consider the relation R(A,B,C,D,E) and
the set of functional dependencies F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }

a. 
List candidate keys of R
Candidate key a minimal superkey: all other attributes derivable

ABCDE is a superkey

Reduce superkey ABCDE with fd A -> B to ACDE
Can't reduce superkey ACDE with BC -> E because B doesn't exist
Reduce superkey ACDE with ED -> A to CDE
Candidate key found: CDE
CDE+ = {C, D, E, A, B}

Reduce superkey ABCDE with fd BC -> E to ABCD
Reduce superkey ABCD with fd A -> B to ACD
Can't reduce superkey ACD with fd ED -> A because ED doesn't exist
Candidate key found: ACD

Repeat reducing superkey ABCDE starting with ED -> A

Eventually: 3 candidate keys are CDE, ACD, BCD.

b. 
Is R in third normal form (3NF)?

A -> B is not trivial
A is not a superkey
B is a subset of any candidate key
A -> B meets the requirements for 3NF

BC -> E is not trivial
BC is not a superkey 
E is a subset of candidate key CDE
BC -> E

ED -> A is not trivial
ED is not a superkey
A is a subset of a candidate key ACD

Because all three functional dependencies meet the requirements,
Our relation R is in 3NF



c. Is R in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)?
R(A, B, C, D, E)
F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }
Eventually: 3 candidate keys are CDE, ACD, BCD.

A -> B is not trivial
A is not a superkey
A -> B violates both rules for BCNF

Therefore R is not in BCNF
